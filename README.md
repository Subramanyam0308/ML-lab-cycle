# 🤖 Machine Learning Lab Cycle

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my Machine Learning Lab Cycle repository. This is where I’ve collected all the core algorithms we practiced as part of our ML coursework. Each code here is written from scratch to really understand *how things work under the hood* — no fancy libraries like scikit-learn!

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

Here are the algorithms I’ve implemented, each in its own Python file:

| 💡 Algorithm | 📄 What it Does |
|-------------|------------------|
| **A\*** | A smart pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest route from start to goal using heuristics. |
| **AO\*** | Used to solve problems where outcomes involve AND/OR decisions — works well with decision trees. |
| **EM (Expectation Maximization)** | Iterative algorithm used for clustering and handling missing or hidden data. |
| **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** | A simple and effective way to classify data based on the closest examples. |
| **LWSS (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing)** | A regression technique that fits data locally — great for capturing patterns in noisy datasets. |
| **Candidate Elimination** | A hypothesis-driven learning algorithm that filters out inconsistent models. |
| **TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem)** | A classic optimization problem — find the shortest path that visits every city once and returns to the start. |

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. Make sure you have **Python** installed.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where this code is saved.
4. Run the script like this:

```bash
python filename.py
